Phishing Email Detector
By Team HIGH FIVE!
This project presents an advanced Phishing Email Detector designed to identify and flag suspicious emails with high accuracy. Our solution leverages multiple AI models and intelligent content analysis to provide real-time threat predictions.

Problem Statement
The pervasive threat of phishing emails necessitates a robust and reliable detection system to protect users from malicious attacks and data breaches. This project addresses the critical need for an effective tool to identify and mitigate phishing attempts.

How We Solved the Problem
Our Phishing Email Detector employs a multi-faceted approach to identify phishing attempts:


Intelligent Content Scan: The system meticulously cleans email content and pinpoints hidden threats within messages.


Automatic Clue Detection: It extracts dozens of suspicious indicators from each email, helping to flag potential phishing attempts.


Multi-Expert AI Training: We trained five different AI models on over 40,000 emails, enabling them to become highly effective phishing detection experts.


Superior Combined Accuracy: These diverse models work together in an ensemble, ensuring highly reliable and accurate threat predictions.

Features of Our Program
Our program offers a comprehensive set of features designed for effective phishing detection:


Smart Text Cleanup: Includes HTML removal, URL/Email Tokenization, and word streamlining for efficient processing of email content.


Comprehensive Indicators: Extracts dozens of suspicious clues using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and Count Vectorization techniques.


Ensemble AI: Utilizes five distinct machine learning algorithms working collaboratively for powerful and reliable detection.


Validated Performance: Achieves high accuracy, validated through techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), cross-validation, and key performance metrics.


User-Friendly Interface: Provides real-time analysis via a Graphical User Interface (GUI), displaying confidence scores and clear indicators for user interpretation.
